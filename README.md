Project Description:
We’re going to analyze CO2 emissions data at the state level in the U.S. Additionally, we will analyze CO2 emissions and death by air pollution data on a global level by country to explore the relationship between CO2 emissions and air pollution related deaths. We will also incorporate the Google Weather and Geocode API to discover any trends in climate change as it relates to carbon emission. 

Research Question:
-Is there a relationship between wealth distribution and co2 emissions in the U.S. by state (and globally by country)?
-Is there a relationship between co2 emissions and deaths caused by air pollution?
-What are top/bottom 5 carbon emitters in the U.S. and the globe?
-Is there a relationship between climate (temperature) and co2 emissions?

Datasets and API’s:

-U.S. Energy Information Administration CO2 Emissions Dataset
-U.S. Energy Information Administration Median Income Dataset (U.S. States)
-World Population Review Median Income Dataset for Country
-CO2 GHG emissions dataset (Kaggle)
-Death Due to Air Pollution dataset (Kaggle)
